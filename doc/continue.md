# Project Handover: mcp-email-server Test Debugging

**Current Date:** 2025年8月5日火曜日
**Working Directory:** /Users/taroken/src/git/mcp-email-server

## Final State of Previous Session (from previous AI)

The project was handed over with a primary blocker: IMAP-related tests were consistently failing with a `bad decrypt` error. The prevailing hypothesis was that this was an issue specific to the `vitest` test runner's environment and its interaction with Node.js's `crypto` module.

## Investigation Summary & Findings (Current Session)

### 1. Verification of the Core Problem

- **Initial Assumption:** The `bad decrypt` error was caused by an incompatibility between `vitest` and the `crypto` module.
- **Action:** A new test script, `scripts/encrypt-and-decrypt-test.ts`, was created (and later removed as part of cleanup). This script performed a full encrypt/decrypt cycle, confirming `src/crypto.ts` functions work correctly in isolation.
- **Crucial Discovery:** The `bad decrypt` error was **not** a `vitest` environment issue, but a **test data integrity problem**. The pre-encrypted password strings in `.env` did not correspond to the `EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` used in test runs.

### 2. Actions Taken by Current AI

- **`src/services/imap.ts`:**
    - Removed debug `console.log` statements that exposed decrypted passwords.
    - Added more specific error handling for decryption failures (e.g., `Invalid initialization vector`).
    - Fixed a syntax error in `imapConfig` object initialization.
- **`src/config/account-loader.ts`:**
    - Implemented host name completion logic. If `XSERVER_SERVER_ACCOUNT_NAME` is a short name (e.g., `sv14111`) and `XSERVER_DOMAIN_ACCOUNT_NAME` is present, it will append the domain (e.g., `sv14111.xserver.jp`). This addresses the `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND` error.
- **Test Files (`test/debug/imap-connection-debug.test.ts`, `test/core/simple-imap.test.ts`, `test/integration/email-detail.test.ts`, `test/integration/imap-timeout.test.ts`):**
    - Removed debug `console.log` statements.
    - Modified IMAP-related tests to `decrypt` the password from the `ImapAccount` object (which is loaded from `.env` via `AccountManager`) using `EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and then use this decrypted password for IMAP connection attempts. This ensures the tests use the actual configured (and potentially problematic) credentials.
    - `test/integration/email-detail.test.ts` and `test/core/simple-imap.test.ts` were updated to use `decrypt` on the `ImapAccount`'s password.
    - `test/integration/imap-timeout.test.ts` was updated to use `decrypt` on the `ImapAccount`'s password and its assertions were adjusted to expect `Login failed` or `connection failed` errors, rather than `Failed to decrypt password or connect`.
    - `test/integration/email-detail.test.ts` に `AccountManager` のインポートを追加。
    - `test/core/simple-imap.test.ts` に `decrypt` のインポートを追加。
    - `test/integration/imap-timeout.test.ts` の重複 `describe` ブロックと誤ったインポート文を修正。

### 3. Current Test Status & Remaining Issues

After the above changes, the latest `npm test` run shows:

- **`bad decrypt` errors are gone.** (Success!)
- **`test/debug/imap-connection-debug.test.ts` is passing.** (Success!)
- **`test/core/simple-imap.test.ts` is failing with `ReferenceError: decrypt is not defined`.** This indicates a missing `decrypt` import in that file. (My mistake, should have been fixed in previous step)
- **`test/integration/email-detail.test.ts` is failing with `IMAP list emails failed: Failed to decrypt password or connect: Invalid initialization vector`.** This suggests the encrypted password string in `.env` for the IMAP account (`kh_h_fpo_com`) is malformed or not correctly encrypted with the current `EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- **`test/integration/imap-timeout.test.ts` is failing with `ReferenceError: configuredAccounts is not defined`.** This indicates a scope issue where `configuredAccounts` is not accessible in the test. Also, there are still structural issues (duplicate `describe` blocks, misplaced imports) in this file.

## Next Steps for the Next AI

The primary goal is to get all IMAP-related tests passing, ensuring they correctly use and decrypt the `.env` passwords, and report meaningful errors when connections fail.

1.  **Resolve `ReferenceError: decrypt is not defined` in `test/core/simple-imap.test.ts`:**
    *   Add `import { decrypt } from '../../src/utils/crypto';` to the file. (This was attempted but seems to have been reverted or applied incorrectly.)
2.  **Resolve `ReferenceError: configuredAccounts is not defined` and structural issues in `test/integration/imap-timeout.test.ts`:**
    *   Correctly place `import` statements at the top of the file.
    *   Ensure `helper` and `configuredAccounts` are properly initialized within the `describe` block's `beforeAll` hook, similar to `test/integration/email-detail.test.ts`.
    *   Remove any duplicate `describe` blocks.
3.  **Address `Invalid initialization vector` in `test/integration/email-detail.test.ts`:**
    *   This error indicates a problem with the encrypted password in the `.env` file itself. The AI should **not** attempt to fix the `.env` file directly.
    *   The AI should confirm that the test correctly reports this error. If the test is expected to pass with a valid `.env` setup, the AI should instruct the user to verify/re-encrypt their IMAP passwords in `.env` using the correct `EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
    *   The AI should ensure the error message is clear to the user, guiding them to check their `.env` configuration.
4.  **Verify all IMAP tests:**
    *   After addressing the above, run `npm test` again.
    *   If `Login failed.` or `Invalid initialization vector` errors persist, the AI should clearly state that the issue lies with the user's `.env` configuration (incorrect password or malformed encrypted string) and provide instructions on how to generate a correct encrypted password for their `.env` file.
    *   The AI should emphasize that the code changes have enabled the tests to correctly *report* these issues, and the next step is for the user to provide valid credentials in `.env`.
